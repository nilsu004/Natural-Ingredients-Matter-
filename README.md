# Does Natural Ingredients Matter?
Hi, I’m Nilsu Saraçlar. This project is for the DSA 210 course and explores whether cosmetic products with natural ingredients get higher user ratings. 
### **Motivation** 
Nowadays, with the rising trend of “good ingredients”,  people are looking for products that are natural and clean. But does this apply to cosmetics too, or are we still influenced by social media collaborations and advertisements? In this project, I want to explore whether skincare products with natural and clean ingredients actually get higher user ratings, or if other factors like marketing and brand popularity play a bigger role.

### Research Question
Do cosmetic products with natural ingredients get higher user ratings than products without natural ingredients?
### Hypotheses
**H₀** : There is no significant difference in user ratings between products with natural ingredients and those without.

**H₁** : Products with natural ingredients have higher user ratings than products without natural ingredients.
### Data Collection
I will gather information from publicly available cosmetics datasets from Kaggle. This dataset that I found contains details about products brand, name, price, number of reviews, number of loves, review score, size, clean product status, and category. I will use this information to analyze whether natural ingredients have an impact on product ratings.

After preparing the data, it will be ready for  data analysis, hypothesis testing, and visualization. This approach will allow me to compare natural and not natural products in a meaningful way and come up with a conclusions about their user ratings.

### Expected Outcome
If the is_natural variable is positively associated with higher ratings (p < 0.05), the study will suggest that natural ingredients contribute to consumer satisfaction.
Otherwise, it may indicate that factors such as price or brand reputation are stronger predictors.
