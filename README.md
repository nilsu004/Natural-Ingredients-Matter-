# Turkish vs Indian Movies Over Time

## Project Overview
This project investigates how Turkish and Indian movies have been rated on IMDb over the years. The goal is to understand whether the ratings of Turkish movies have increased over time and how they compare to Indian movies.

## Motivation
Turkey and India are two countries with rich and vibrant cultures. Culture influences many aspects of life, including movies. Since the 1920s, films from both countries have been a way to share their culture with the world.
In this project, I wanted to examine how Turkish movies have developed over time. I also thought it would be interesting to compare them with Indian movies because movies from each country are popular in the other — for example, Turkish audiences enjoy Indian films, and Indian audiences watch Turkish movies and series.
By comparing Turkish and Indian movies, I can study how ratings have changed over time and how audience preferences differ between the two countries. The main focus is on analyzing the development of Turkish cinema, but including Indian movies makes the project more interesting and informative.

## Data Collecting
I collected the data from Kaggle. I used two datasets: one containing information about Turkish movies, including ratings, genres, runtime, and release year; and another containing the same information for Indian movies. Both datasets will be filtered and cleaned to remove missing values, ensuring accurate analysis.



## Limitations and Future Work
- The dataset may not include all movies from both countries.  
- Ratings may be biased by the number of voters or popularity.  
- Future work: include box office performance, awards, or social media metrics.  
- Explore genre-specific trends for more detailed analysis.
